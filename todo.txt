UI HIGH PRIORITY
update main page state per ui spec
deposit
withdrawal
sign out

UI LOW PRIORITY
home does not load until stress_tester.dist.js (6.9 mbs) and keys wasm loads
Save your backup phrase screen while loading should be fixed size, continue button should be disabled to prevent advancing
ui tweaks (restore height spacing, background coloring, max page height, etc)
enter key invokes continue buttons
do not confirm losing sync progress?
remove disabled icon/attribute on buttons (only styled and non-clickable)
button text should not be highlightable

TX GENERATION
freeze or sweep dust on unspendable outputs
compute time to unlock with non-frozen outputs
error after wakeUp() called occasionally
balance is non-deterministic restoring from mnemonic
don't spam messages from _spendAvailableOutputs()
handle dust wallet balance
tps should be factor in computing how many outputs to split; tweak output growth; not how many are currently available but how many will be available after they unlock
tx generator's listener has status message which should be updated to button so status reflects what's happening instead of what happened
num blocks to next/last unlock based on 10 confirmations; base on unlock height for mined txs
balance is incorrect after first tx
numBlocksToNext/LastUnlock not computed until first block or transaction, but not on initial main
resume sending transactions on notification of available balance
vary size of multi-output tx to improve privacy?
not enough unlocked money errors on sweep txs past 600 txs; freeze to ignore, allow isDust: false on output query?
cannot pay for itself errors past 800 txs
